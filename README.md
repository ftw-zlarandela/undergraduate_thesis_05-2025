This is my undergraduate thesis, the Development of a Robust Watermarking Model for Advanced Video Coding Samples using Deep Learning as the final requirement for my Computer Engineering Degree in UPLB. I presented this last 15th of May, 2025.
Feel free to check this out as my first ever major project which converges signal processing with machine learning.
